        <h2><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></h2>
        <p>
            Some people play Forza Horizon 5 for its <em><strong>gorgeous scenery</strong></em> or <em><strong>accurate vehicles</strong></em>. Some play it for its online community and competitive races. Others are into making detailed custom designs or completing challenges. <br/> Still, others like to drive cars off cliffs. The brilliance of Forza Horizon 5 is the way in which it welcomes and embraces every one of these types of people by presenting enough roadway for them to drive on for miles. <br/> Its adoring rendition of Mexico is beautiful from coast to jungle, from city to desert, peppered with <em><strong>ever-changing weather</strong></em> and <em><strong>real-world details</strong></em> that make driving through it all — which is a lot! — a joy. <br/> <br/>
